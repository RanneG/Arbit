# Trading Stats Guide

This guide explains the trading-related stats on each card and how they relate to crypto trading concepts.

## Card Stats Overview

Each trading card has four stats that teach crypto trading concepts:

### 📈 Buy Up (Long Position)
**Range:** 0-100

**What it means:** This represents a character's ability to profit when prices rise. In crypto trading, a "long position" means you buy an asset expecting its price to go up.

**Real-world example:** If Bitcoin is at $40,000 and you think it will go to $50,000, you "go long" by buying Bitcoin. If the price rises, you profit.

**On the card:** Higher values mean the character is better at identifying and capitalizing on upward price movements.

### 📉 Sell Down (Short Position)
**Range:** 0-100

**What it means:** This represents a character's ability to profit when prices fall. In crypto trading, a "short position" means you sell an asset you don't own, expecting its price to drop, then buy it back cheaper.

**Real-world example:** If you think Bitcoin will drop from $40,000 to $30,000, you "short" it. If the price falls, you profit.

**On the card:** Higher values mean the character is better at identifying and capitalizing on downward price movements.

### ⚖️ Risk Power (Leverage)
**Range:** 0-100

**What it means:** This represents risk management and position sizing ability. "Leverage" in trading means borrowing money to increase your position size, which amplifies both profits and losses.

**Real-world example:** With 10x leverage, a 10% price move becomes a 100% gain (or loss). Higher leverage = higher risk and reward.

**On the card:** Higher values mean the character can handle larger positions and manage risk effectively. Lower values mean they're more conservative.

---

### 🧠 Market Smarts (Market IQ)
**Range:** 0-100

**What it means:** This represents understanding of market dynamics, trends, and timing. It's about knowing when to enter and exit trades.

**Real-world example:** A trader with high Market IQ understands market cycles, reads charts well, and knows when market sentiment is shifting.

**On the card:** Higher values mean the character has better intuition about market movements and timing.

## How Stats Work Together

- **High Buy Up + High Market Smarts** = Great at catching upward trends
- **High Sell Down + High Market Smarts** = Great at catching downward trends  
- **High Risk Power** = Can handle volatile markets and larger positions
- **High Market Smarts** = Better overall trading decisions

## Learning Through Play

These stats are designed to make crypto trading concepts accessible:
- **Novice-friendly labels** (Buy Up instead of Long Position)
- **Visual representation** (bars showing 0-100)
- **Gamified learning** (collecting cards with different stat combinations)

## Integration with Pear API

These stats map to concepts used in pair trading:
